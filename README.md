T1-Prediction of SalesðŸ“Šusing XGBoostðŸŒŸ.
UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM STATEMENT :
According to the quote, "Success in sales is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in & day out"

Let us consider a supermarket has several outlets or several stores around the world & they want us to predict the sales which they can expect.

APPLICATION OF PREDICTING THE SALES :
We can tell the company what are all the challenges they may face

What are the brands or products which is sold the most & other such kind of things

This helps sales team to understand which product to sell & which product to promote & other such kind of things

They can also make several marketing plans(let's say that a particular product in a particular store is getting sold the most & we may find some insights from it - as of why this product is getting sold the most & this helps the company to make better marketing decisions)
