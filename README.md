Welcome to the GitHub repository for my internship at **Brainwave Metrix Solution**. This repository showcases the projects I completed during my internship, demonstrating my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and sentiment analysis using various tools and techniques. Each project focuses on solving real-world problems through data-driven insights.

# Task-1
T1-**Prediction of SalesðŸ“Šusing XGBoostðŸŒŸ.**
**UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM STATEMENT :**
- According to the quote, "Success in sales is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in & day out"

- Let us consider a supermarket has several outlets or several stores around the world & they want us to predict the sales which they can expect.

# APPLICATION OF PREDICTING THE SALES :
- We can tell the company what are all the challenges they may face

- What are the brands or products which is sold the most & other such kind of things

- This helps sales team to understand which product to sell & which product to promote & other such kind of things

- They can also make several marketing plans(let's say that a particular product in a particular store is getting sold the most & we may find some insights from it - as of why this product is getting sold the most & this helps the company to make better marketing decisions)
